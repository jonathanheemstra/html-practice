            <h2>Where and who and what and why</h2>
          </header>
            <p>Here's the scoop, gang. It's late May and the Seattle Mariners are not messing around in regard to playoff baseball. Coming off a sweep in Ohio, the M's find themselves solidly in first place in the AL West. They have the second-best winning percentage in the entire AL behind a team they just took two of three against in Camden Yards. What's more, the preseason darling Houston Astros are currently ten games behind the M's in the standings. The field has narrowed considerably heading towards June.</p>
            <p>Taking into account that the M's will be, in all likelihood, very much in the thick of things come July, they'll probably be looking to bolster the roster in some fashion. Now, we all have a very short history with being "buyers" come July. The last time this all went down, I was on a farm and got a text that we grabbed Austin Jackson. That was pretty cool. Kendrys Morales was stuffed into a carry-on Michael Kors bag in Minnesota and flown on Alaska 39 to Seattle. That was good, too. OR SO I THOUGHT.</p>
            <p>Buying at the deadline is a tricky science. You don't want to mortgage your future, but you also have gaps to fill. Two wins can make all the difference down the stretch, and a clutch double or stolen base can win a playoff series. The margins are thin. Just like when I go looking for a new pair of shoes, a nice white wine for a light pasta dinner, or my next catamaran, I'm looking for value. Let's get some bangs out of those bucks.</p>
            <p>First and foremost, we must address the Mariners as an organization. This is a bit difficult to forecast, and all of this should be taken with several grains of salt, because we can't be sure what the next two months of baseball will truly yield. But we can still use our imaginations. Let's assume the roster holds basically true to current form, forego any major injuries (please), and presume the rest of the league essentially follows suit. In my mind's eye, the roster currently has three "holes", all to different degrees. Let's assume Jerry decides to go about filling them with current MLB talent, foregoing the Farm.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p><b>First Ba(s)e</b> - Adam Lind is a proven bat against right handed pitching. There is no doubt his track record is an astounding one and that he should eventually start mashing. However, what if he just...you know...doesn't? There will be a lot of crying for Dae-Ho Lee as a full-time player at first, but how comfortable can this team be with that being the solution at the major league level for a division-title chasing team? I think, if Lind continues under-performing, the organization will feel just as I do with Lee in regard to a full-time job: maybe...not. At least some insurance not named Stefen Romero should be considered.</p>
            <p><b>Left Field, Or Nori Aoki's Spot</b> - Aoki was a great buy-low job by Dipoto in the offseason. It brought in an OBP machine who played, and this feels a little disrespectful to the trade of fielding, a tolerable corner outfield. However, we've yet to see the true table-setting side of Aoki. His K% is higher than ever before, and the eye test has showed that he's been a bit of a rally-killer when the lineup turns over. Furthermore, his defense won't keep him on the field if the production at the plate keeps stalling. Whether Guti has run out of that Magic Space Dust(tm) he found last year or not, he can't play every day, and this roster may need an upgrade from Aoki.</p>
            <p><b>Bullpen</b> - This is essentially a need for any team buying at the deadline and one of the more readily purchasable assets for teams willing to pay the price. Sure, there's theoretically help coming in the form of Charlie Furbush, Tony Zych, Evan Scribner, and Ryan Cook. Edwin Diaz is down in Double-A striking out tons of folks and touching 98, but he's an unproven commodity. Hoping for the DL to sort itself out and Edwin Diaz to blossom is, well, hoping. We may need an arm of two for the final stretch, folks.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>Now, that we've talked about the spots that Jerry and Co. may choose to address, let's briefly consider what the M's have to offer in a potential package. This is an essentially fruitless exercise to do exhaustively, since organizations contain SO many players, but looking around AAA and below there are certainly some interesting pieces that are movable. To name a few, Boog Powell, Rob Brantly, Mike Zunino, Stefen Romero, and Adrian Sampson all may be pieces worth kicking tires on for another organization. Additionally, James Paxton is down in Tacoma, and he was again sitting in the mid-90s this weekend. Diaz, Drew Jackson, and Alex Jackson (not related) could get a few talks going. I'm not willing, because it's rather pointless to speculate, on the potential package for any of the players I'll get into, but the M's aren't fully void of interesting pieces for teams looking to reset for next year.</p>
            <p>Finally, and this is the last thing before we get into some players here, it is important to consider who might be selling come deadline time. I think it's safe to say that the Reds, Padres, Brewers, Angels, and Braves will all be selling come July and the right buyer. Other squads I think who are willing to sell will be the disappointing Yankees, A's, and Twins. I have no clue what is going on with the Phillies, but they're probably sellers too, in the end. Finally, and it's a couple wild cards as well, Colorado might consider a small reload at the right price. So, let's look at those ten squads for potential acquisitions. By no means is the following list exhaustive.</p>
            <p><b>FIRST BASE</b> - Preferably looking for a non-platoon, every day starter.</p>
            <p><b>Joe Mauer - Minnesota</b></p>
            <p>Twins Joe Mauer is thirty-three, signed through 2018, and back in 2009 when his contract was extended, was the Golden Child of a Twins franchise with a brand new stadium. A lot has changed since those times when the Twins looked like a potential dynasty, one of those being Mauer's value. Since he moved from catcher to first, and stopped doing the hair ads, Mauer's game is that of a totally different player. After posting by far the worst season of his career in 2015, he's experienced a bit of a renaissance, walking as much as he's striking out and getting on base a ton. The Twins would probably have to eat some contract to move Mauer, but the appeal of getting out from under his big money with a struggling franchise could be enough to see him go.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, it's too early to forecast exactly what we'll be shopping for come July, yet I hope this gives a nice overview of potential targets given the current state of the roster and its production. I'm sure some here will think that the M's could do with looking for an arm for the rotation in July, and while I think it's possible, I just don't see it as a top priority. This organization only has so many chips. Do I think that the M's are legitimately in pursuit of any of these targets, especially the big-money splashes? Not necessarily, probably relatively unlikely. It's hard for me to imagine Freddie Freeman's contract coming on top of the current payroll. Yet, there's a window here and it's an undeniable one. A player like Kole Calhoun or Brett Gardner could be available, and really change things for the M's in a big, positive way. Here's to another week of Winning Baseball and as always, dingers.</p>
